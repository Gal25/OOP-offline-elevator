# OOP-Ex1
This project is an assignment in an object-oriented course at Ariel University.
The purpose of the task is to find an optimal solution to the offline-elevator problem.
The challenge of the elevator problem is - given a call to the elevator from the source floor to the destination floor - the system will want to embed the elevator that will reduce the arrival time to a minimum. That is, more generally it is said that given a collection of lifts calls in time we would like to define an elevator placement strategy for calls that will minimize the total arrival time for all calls.
In this solution to the elevator problem we got a json file defined as a building as well as a csv file which we were a file containing the total readings.
