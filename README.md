# OOP-Ex1
This project is an assignment in an object-oriented course at Ariel University.
The purpose of the task is to find an optimal solution to the elevator problem.
The challenge of the elevator problem is - given a call to the elevator from the source floor to the destination floor - the system will want to embed the elevator that will reduce the arrival time to a minimum. That is, more generally it is said that given a collection of lifts calls in time we would like to define an elevator placement strategy for calls that will minimize the total arrival time for all calls.
